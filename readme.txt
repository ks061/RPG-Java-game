This project is called Bibbin's Adventures (CSCI 205 Edition) and was made by PNNSD (Post Neural Net Stress Disorder), which is a team made up of Logan Stiles, Kartikeya Sharma (scrum master), Claudia Shrefler (project owner), and Jason Kang. You can find the project by opening "CSCI205FinalProject.jar" in the folder titled "dist". The file RPGMain contains the main file to run our program.
The game is optimized for 1400 pixels (width) x 800 pixels (length)
IF, BY CHANCE, THE GAME DOES NOT FIT ON YOUR SCREEN SIZE, PLEASE RESIZE YOUR SCREEN TO BE AT LEAST THOSE DIMENSIONS. We are aware that Professor Dancy currently uses a Mac computer, and so we will provide instructions to resize your display (assuming that you are using the latest Mac operating system macOS Mojave). Kindly follow the following instructions to debug issues with displaying the game.
1. Open System Preferences
2. Click on Displays
3. Ensure that the Display tab is clicked (should be by default)
4. Click on the “Scaled” radio button under “Resolution” menu.
5. Click “More Space,” which should provide a screen resolution of 1680 x 1050.
        The reason why we chose a larger display is to increase the pixel density and/or quality 
of the game.        


Bibbin's Adventures (CSCI 205 Edition) is a point-and click role playing game in which you play as one of the four members of our team. Your goal is to navigate the game, performing various tasks until you can fight the final boss: Angry Dance. In this game you have health, indicated by the red circles in the top left screen, big circles represent ten health points, while small circles represent one health point. If the health bar in the top left ever becomes empty, you are considered "dead" and the game will close after a brief message. The bar in the top right is the health of the NPC in the room you are currently in, if that bar is depleted that NPC will die. Therefore it is your goal to find Angry Dance, and deplete his health, in which you will win the game and the game will close after a brief message.
        In this game you can traverse between rooms by clicking the arrows on the sides of the screen, which will appear if you hover the mouse over the doors. Every room has an NPC in it. Click on the image to hear them say something (it may be important). However, if they are dead you will loot their body instead. The backpack on the bottom right opens your inventory. You can drag items on the screen to your inventory directly or drag them to the backpack to put them in your inventory. You can equip weapons, armor, and shields in your inventory to your right arm, torso, and left arm respectively, which will increase some of your stats (such as max health, attack, defense, and inventory size) and increase your odds of finishing the game. Consumable items such as ramen, nacho tots, and milkshakes can be dragged to your player character's head to eat them, which will also increase your stats. The magnifying glass on the bottom right allows you to search dead bodies. The attack bubble with the fist in it allows you to attack the NPC you are currently in the room with, and they will counter attack, meaning both you and the NPC may lose some health. When you click it, action bubbles will appear, wait for these bubbles to go away before you try to attack again. You can't attack NPCs considered to be dead or friendly. The blue and orange arrows on the bottom right allow you to trade an item with the 
NPC you are currently in the room with, you may only trade with them if they are alive, they want an item, and you have the item they want in your inventory.
