Name of your team: PNNSD (Post-Neural Net Stress Disorder)

Project chosen: Text-based & GUI-interactive RPG

Project description: The user will control a player via interacting with a GUI. The GUI is broken down into three sections:
a text description of the user’s surroundings, an artistic representation, and an actions menu, which will way the user interacts with the method.
This player can move between rooms, have items, trade items, talk with friendly NPCs, fight hostile NPCs and loot their bodies,
and search the room they are in for items. The game map is made up of nodes, which we refer to as ‘rooms,’ that are connected via edges,
which we refer to as ‘doors.’ We may implement a tree to represent different paths within the group.
All characters in the game will have four stats (although we may add more): health, strength, defense, and inventory size.
Items in the game can be used in two ways: consuming them (things such as food and potions) and equipping them (swords, armor, and shields).
The game will use an object-oriented approach that will allow us to expand the map and the mechanics of the game if we decide it ought to be expanded.
